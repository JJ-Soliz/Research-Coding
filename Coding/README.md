Samples of coding I have done over the years involving astronomy in Python.
- Astr650_research_coding is Python coding I used to data analyze survery data of galaxies, create tables, create plot of WISE diagram, and calculate X-Ray Luminosity. Explained in Research/SolizJ_Astr650_final_presentation_AGNMerger.pdf
- astr680.final-age.ipynb is coding and SolizJ_Astr680_final_2021.pdf of a project for Astronomical Techniques course at SDSU on measuring the Hubble Constant and age of the universe through Philips Relation of observations of Type Ia Supernovae.
- tov.nb and tov_practice.nb are a Mathematica files used for undergraduate research in neutron star research.  
- astr680.proj04.ipynb is an midterm assignmemt for Astronomical Techniques course at SDSU of spectroscopic data from the Keck archive to measure the redshift of a supernova's host galaxy.
- Astr630_HW4.ipynb Stellar Atmosphere and Evolution assignment of Gamow peak versus particle energy of Li Burning and burning lines for pp-chain and CNO-cycle.
- astr630_HW3.ipynb Stellar Atmosphere and Evolution assignment of semi-realistic stellar structure and HR Diagram evolution track from the MIST (MESA Isochrones and Stellar Tracks) of exoplanet host.
- SolizJ_Astr630_HW1.ipynb Stellar Atmosphere and Evolution assignment on selecting stars in Gaia data and creating color-absolute magnitude diagram.
