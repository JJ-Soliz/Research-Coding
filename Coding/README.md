Samples of coding I have done over the years involving astronomy in Python.
- Astr650_research_coding is Python coding I used to data analyze survery data of galaxies, create tables, create plot of WISE diagram, and calculate X-Ray Luminosity. Explained in Research/SolizJ_Astr650_final_presentation_AGNMerger.pdf
- astr680.final-age.ipynb is coding and SolizJ_Astr680_final_2021.pdf of a project for Astronomical Techniques course at SDSU on measuring the Hubble Constant and age of the universe through Philips Relation of observations of Type Ia Supernovae.
- tov.nb and tov_practice.nb are a Mathematica files used for undergraduate research in neutron star research.  
- More to be added.
